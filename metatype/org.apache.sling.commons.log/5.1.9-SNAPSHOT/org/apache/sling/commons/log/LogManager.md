# Apache Sling Logging Configuration (`org.apache.sling.commons.log.LogManager`)

Global configuration setup for the Sling OSGi LogService implementation. See http://sling.apache.org/site/logging.html for more detailed documentation and description.

| ID  | Name | Required | Type | Default value | Description |
| --- | ---- | -------- | ---- | ------------- | ----------- |
| org.apache.sling.commons.log.level | Log Level | `true` | `String` | `[info]` | Root Logger log level setting. |
| org.apache.sling.commons.log.file | Log File | `true` | `String` | `[logs/error.log]` | The name and path of the log file. If this is empty, logging goes to standard output (the console). If this path is relative it is resolved below ${sling.home}. |
| org.apache.sling.commons.log.file.number | Number of Log Files | `true` | `Integer` | `[5]` | The number of log files to keep. When the threshold of the log file reaches the configured maximum (see Log File Threshold), the log file is copied and a new log file is created. This setting specifies how many generations (incl. the active log file) should be kept. This is a positive numeric value. The default value is 5. If the Log File Threshold property specifies time/date controlled log file rotation, log file deletion can be disabled by setting the number of log files to '0'. Warning: setting this to a high number (more than 20) may be expensive on some file-systems, because all files need to be renamed when log files are rotated. |
| org.apache.sling.commons.log.file.size | Log File Threshold | `true` | `String` | `['.'yyyy-MM-dd]` | Controls the rotation of the log file by setting a maximum file size or a time/date schedule at which to rotate the log file. A size limit can be specified setting a pure number indicating the number of bytes or a number with a size indicator KB, MB, or GB (case is ignored). A time/date schedule can be specified as a java.util.SimpleDateFormat pattern. The default is "'.'yyyy-MM-dd" (daily log rotation). |
| org.apache.sling.commons.log.pattern | Message Pattern | `true` | `String` | `[%d{dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss.SSS} *%level* [%thread] %logger %msg%n]` | Message Pattern for formatting the log messages. For complete details refer to http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#ClassicPatternLayout |
| org.apache.sling.commons.log.configurationFile | Logback Config File | `true` | `String` | `null` | The name and path of the Logback Config file. If this is empty, then default configuration would be used. If this path is relative it is resolved below ${sling.home}. See http://logback.qos.ch/manual/ for details. |
| org.apache.sling.commons.log.packagingDataEnabled | Packaging Data | `true` | `Boolean` | `null` | Include the packaging data which provide details about jar name and version of jar from which the class is loaded as part of stacktrace. See http://logback.qos.ch/reasonsToSwitch.html#packagingData |
| org.apache.sling.commons.log.maxCallerDataDepth | Max Caller Depth | `true` | `Integer` | `[7]` | The stack data depth computed during caller data extraction. See http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#caller |
| org.apache.sling.commons.log.maxOldFileCountInDump | Max Count of files in dump | `true` | `Integer` | `[3]` | Maximum number of old rolled over files for each active file to be included while generating the dump as part of Status zip support |
| org.apache.sling.commons.log.numOfLines | Number of lines | `true` | `Integer` | `[1000]` | Number of lines from each log files to include while generating the dump in 'txt' mode. If set to -1 then whole file would be included |
